# Simple Hotel-Reservation-System

My first larger C++ Project that i did in my Introduction to C++ -course

In this project I made a simple hotel reservation system that holds 50 slots of customers.

In this hotel you can: check in, check out and leave.

When checking in, the program will ask for personal details and save it into a struct.

Your details can be found with your reservation number which is randomly generated.

When checking out, the program will ask for your reservation number and then delete your information.
